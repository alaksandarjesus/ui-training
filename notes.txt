Webdevelopment
    -> Front End Development (HTML, CSS & JS)
    -> Backend Development (PHP, RUBY, JAVA) && (Databases)
    
Front End Development (HTML, CSS & JS)
    -> HTML
        -> Defined with tags <>
        -> display the data
        -> hide the data but use it for processing
        -> error not thrown, you need to check it with IDE
        -> id and class, which will act as a reference for the element
    -> CSS
        -> style the page (change the properties of the html)(on load only)
        -> background, color, margin, padding, displays
        -> error will be thrown, css code will not work (for wrong syntax)
            {
                display:block  /*miss the semicolon*/
                background:black;
            }
        -> id and class, which will act as a reference for the element
    -> JS
        -> can change the properties of the html tags on the fly
        -> capture the user actions -> click/move the mouse/ enter a key
        -> in case of error, you can see the error in console outputs in developer tools
        -> id and class, which will act as a reference for the element
        
Core codes -> 90% we dont use core codes.

Open source codes (Free to download and Free to use)

CSS -> Frameworks
        -> Bootstrap
        -> Foundation
        -> pure
        -> materialize
        
        -> All codes are coded with classes
            -> copy the respective class and put it in your html class attribute
            -> search for buttons -> size (lg, sm, md), color(5 colors), display(btn-block, btn-group)
            -> <button class="btn-lg btn-primary">SignIn</button>
            
JS  -> Libraries (standalone, pure javascript codes) -> jQuery
            -> set of frequently used functions 
                -> Show and hide a element
                    -> dropdown menu
                    -> accordin menus
                    -> login -> login fails, then show the message
                -> $.each
            -> lodash
                -> set of javascript function used not limited to jquery functions
                -> _.each
            -> moment js
                -> work with timings
                    -> about a minute ago
                    -> 5 hours ago
                    -> moment(yourdate).fromNow()
    -> Plugins (dependent on libraries, javascript + html)
            -> default select html can be replaced with good user interface
            -> jQuery will be depenent
            -> calendar
            
    -> Frameworks (Angular, React, Backbone(obselete))
            -> routing + library
            
=========================================================================
Working on a project
        -> development -> develop the code (local server)
        -> production -> ready to use (live server)
        
Working as a team
        -> including libraries for development purpose
        -> change the codes
        -> equivalent to sharing the code in a pendrive,
                -> there will be respository for the code sharing
                -> GitHub
                        -> private projects
                            -> users are restricted
                        -> public project (angularjs, react js)
                            -> any user can access the project files
                            
                ->1. signin with github, bitbucket
                ->2. repository (files are stored)
                ->3. push command to upload files from your local to repository
                ->4. pull command from repo to local
                
                -> create branches
                    -> Create table // branch a
                    -> update table // branch b
                 -> merge the branch a & branch b and make it as a single file   
                 
=============================================================================================
Sharing the libraries
    -> bootstrap -> CSS Framework, which available to all
    
    -> json file that will have the datas of the 3rd party development codes
        -> upload the libraries to the repo but we upload only the json file
        
   To host 3rd party development files
        -> bower, npm, yarn
        -> Have node js in your system
        
        -> use this in command prompt node --version
        -> close the command prompt and reopen again it will work
        
        
        ============================================================
        
        1. you should be in the command prompt on the project folder
            -> open the folder -> click on the address bar and type cmd
        2. git init
        3. add the files
        4. commit the files (short description on what you have done)
        5. push
        ---- create pull request (a notification will be sent to the administrators)----
        
        I am only on the branch codeschange
